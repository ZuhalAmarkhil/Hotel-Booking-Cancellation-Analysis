## Hotel Bookings Cancelation Data Analysis ##

### Description: ###
This project analyzes a real-life hotel stay dataset using the R programming language. Each row in the dataset represents a hotel booking, and the objective was to identify factors influencing booking cancellations. Through this analysis, I aimed to develop predictive models that can forecast booking cancellations and provide insights to optimize hotel booking management and enhance guest satisfaction.

### Libraries Utilized ###
- **tidyverse:** Used for efficient data manipulation. 
- **ggplot2:** Employed for creating insightful data visualizations.
- **corrplot:** Utilized to visualize correlation matrices.
- **RColorBrewer:** Used to define custom color palettes for visualizations.
- **caret:** Applied for machine learning tasks.
- **rpart:** Used for implementing decision tree-based machine learning models.
